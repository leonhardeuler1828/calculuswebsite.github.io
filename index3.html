<td rowspan="5"><p><font color="white" size="5">To your left is the genius creator of this website, Nikesh Kumar Mistry. Nikesh was sick of having to go to "Mills Eagles" and "Type in Tank Trouble 2" to get to his favourite (forbidden word beginning with 'G' and rhymes with 'Same'). He also had an idea that he wanted to try out for himself; would the school's webpage blocking algorithm detect a (forbidden word) website if the (forbidden word) was nowhere to be seen on the website. He disguised the (forbidden word) website as a Calculus Help website, with the amazing Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler, on the homepage. He spent his whole Saturday morning (04.03.17) coding this, it was 11:31 as he was writing this in 3rd person. This was all in an effort not to be detected by Smoothwall. If you're viewing this page then I guess my plan- I mean Nikesh's plan worked! HAHA! SUCK DICK WEBPAGE-BLOCKERS!</font></p></td>
